Next steps to productionize:
- Implement real Email/Calendar/CRM clients with OAuth and rate-limit handling.
- Use a persistent DB for memory (Postgres, Redis) and vector DB for semantic retrieval.
- Add robust NLU: use an LLM with prompt engineering and safety checks.
- Add audit logs and human approval flow for outbound messages.
- Securely store credentials using a secret manager.
